An application that can process speech must have the following capabilities:

It must be able to extract individual words from raw audio data.
It must be able to make educated guesses about the grammatical relationships between the words it has extracted.
The Cloud Speech and Cloud Natural Language APIs enable you to add the above capabilities to your Android app in a matter of minutes.

The Cloud Speech API serves as a state-of-the-art speech recognizer that can accurately transcribe speech in over 80 languages. It can also robustly handle regional accents and noisy conditions.

On a similar note, the Cloud Natural Language API is a language processing system that can, with near-human level accuracy, determine the roles words play in sentences given to it. It currently supports ten languages, and it also offers entity and sentiment analysis.
